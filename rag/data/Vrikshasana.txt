TITLE: Vrikshasana (Tree Pose)
The tree pose is a balance where one foot is placed against the opposite inner thigh.
It is primarily used to develop better stability and mental concentration.
This posture strengthens the legs and helps open the hip joints.
It may offer some relief to those dealing with discomfort from sciatica.
People with vertigo or high blood pressure should avoid this balancing act.
Those with ankle or hip injuries should not attempt this one legged pose.
