TITLE: Utkatasana (Chair Pose)
The chair pose mimics the action of sitting in a chair with the arms raised.
It targets and strengthens the muscles in the legs, back, and core.
This posture helps build a sense of inner willpower and physical balance.
Keep your weight in your heels to protect your joints while practicing.
Avoid this pose if you have any recent injuries to the ankles or knees.
Those with chronic lower back pain should skip this strengthening exercise.
