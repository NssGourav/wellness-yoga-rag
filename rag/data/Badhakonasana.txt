TITLE: Badhakonasana (Butterfly Pose)
This sitting posture involves bringing the soles of the feet together and moving the knees up and down.
It is highly effective for improving flexibility in the inner thighs and hip joints.
The movement helps to stimulate the abdominal organs and can aid in better digestion.
Many people practice this pose to help relieve fatigue from long hours of standing.
Individuals with knee or groin injuries should practice this very gently or avoid it.
It is not recommended to force the knees down if they do not reach the floor naturally.
