TITLE: Dhanurasana (Bow Pose)
In the bow pose, you lie on your stomach and reach back to hold your ankles.
This movement creates a shape that stretches the front of the body and the throat.
It is known for adding great flexibility to the back and strengthening the legs.
The posture helps to massage the internal organs and improve digestive health.
Avoid this pose if you have high blood pressure or a heart condition.
People with migraines or lower back injuries should not attempt this deep stretch.
