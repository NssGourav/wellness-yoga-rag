TITLE: Sukhasana (Easy Pose)
The easy pose is a simple cross-legged sitting position used for centering and breathing. 
It helps to strengthen the back and improve overall body posture. 
This position is widely used as a foundation for seated meditation and relaxation. 
It encourages a sense of mental calm and reduces physical tiredness. 
People with recent or chronic knee injuries should sit on a cushion for support. 
Avoid sitting in this position for long periods if you experience lower back pain.
