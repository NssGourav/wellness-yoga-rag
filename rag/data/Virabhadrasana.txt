TITLE: Virabhadrasana (Warrior Pose)
The warrior pose is a standing lunge with the arms extended high overhead.
It is an excellent posture for increasing stamina and strengthening the arms.
This pose is highly recommended for people with stiff or frozen shoulders.
Practicing this regularly can help bring a sense of courage and grace.
Those with high blood pressure or heart issues should avoid this vigorous pose.
People with chronic injuries to the knees or back should also refrain from it.
