In this pose, the feet are set wide apart as the torso bends toward the floor.
It serves as a grounding posture that stretches the hamstrings and lower back.
This movement is often used to calm the mind and find relaxation.
Blocks can be used to support the hands if the full bend is too intense.
It is generally recommended to avoid this pose during the third trimester of pregnancy.
Individuals with acute lower back pain or knee injuries should skip this pose.
